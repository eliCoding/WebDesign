                is to develop a unique and exciting musical learning environment for students of all ages, ranging from beginner to advanced
                 levels. We aim to provide unique, individualized musical education by offering new and innovative curriculum tailored to

                <p>We have found Melody Art Music Center and we are hooked. Two of my children are enrolled in private lessons as well as the 
                Rock Band program and I am thoroughly impressed with the improvements they have made. They have been in music programs before but have 
                never excelled or enjoyed it as much as they have at Melody Art Music Center. The instructors are so talented and professional and most of 
                all fun! My children have been encouraged to explore a wide range of musical styles and have loved it. I would recommend Melody Art Music Center
                to any family who want a fun and diverse learning experience for their child. Melody Music School has made my children confident and proud to perform 
                at the recitals and they are always looking forward to their next class. Thank you Melody Art Music Center, you guys ROCK!!<br />
